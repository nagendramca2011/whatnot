Dear ABC,

I hope things are well with you.

I was pleased to hear that you will be back in Malaysia again in November to hold your seminar on Effective Business Writing.

Some bookstores are interested in asking you to do a talk and singing event, I hope you will agree to take part.

Please let me have some free date while you are over here, and i will make all the arrangements.

I look forward to hearing from your screen

Your sincerely,

abc
